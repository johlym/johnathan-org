Is that jello and pasta sauce, I smell?

Following up my Lucozade review, I went straight into number two with Irn Bru in my International Beverage Bonanza series. I kid you not, that's how to spell it. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced _Iron Brew_. I think the lack of iron makes you forget how to spell properly.

Irn Bru is in a rather unassuming clear bottle, looking more like a 16oz soda than a carbonated citrus drink with 5% of your daily recommended amount of iron. Unlike the last orange beverage thing I tried, this one has some flavor. Some odd flavor.

Remember, as a kid, when the dentist put fluoride in your mouth to poison your mind for your teeth and you got to pick a flavor? Yeah. This brings back those memories. While I wondered for 20 minutes what Lucozade tasted like, I have no doubts what Irn Bru is trying to get after. Ever drink orange gelatin before it set?

I really hate that I'm making myself drink 12 oz of this mind-altering fluoride water bubble juice. I'm having a really hard time figuring this drink out. The flavor is so crazy compared to how innocuous it looks.

Then again, as a kid, I always wanted more of the tasty fluoride foam so the Illuminati could become supreme overlords I could get more of that orange flavor. As I drink it, it's becoming addicting. Irn Bru is a British Scottish drink that's lying to me, you, to the Queen, and to all of Her Majesty's KingdomTM. The latter half is fine because of its Scottish roots; I hear the Scots have some beef with England.

If I took the wrapper off and told someone it was a new kind of Crush orange soda, they'd believe me.

Did I mention the spelling? Oh, I did. I'll just get back to drinking it.

Besides the 5% DV of iron per serving, there's little nutritional value. At 200 calories, 50 carbs (100% of which is sugar), and a measly 20mg of Sodium, this is true sugar water.

One thing worth noting here is Irn Bru found in the United States contains different ingredients than the UK version. The UK version uses [Ponceau 4R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponceau_4R) (Europe: E-124) for coloring, a coloring not approved by the United Stated Food and Drug Administration for use in food, where as the US version uses [FD&C Yellow Number 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Yellow_FCF) (Also known as Sunset Yellow FCF; Europe: E-110). Like anything FD&C is much better, right?

Barr's has made a legit attempt to make sure Irn Bru is as US legit as possible. It comes with a North American UPC label and everything.

**Taste** – 2/10. The logical side of me is having a hard time with this flavor. Seven-year-old me is metaphorically losing his mind. If my inner child were writing this review, it would be a 10/10.

**Presentation** – 5/10. The package screams “Meh!” and Irn Bru's bland packaging is definitely hiding something. In the right light, the liquid looks like dark urine. Take that for what it's worth.

**Desire** – 2/10. Again, like the taste, adult Johnathan is nearing repulsion. Seven-year-old me is now spazzing out.

**Overall** – 9/30. If you're over the age of seven, don't even think about it. The exception is those who drink jello before it sets or they have odd fixations with funky-@$$ citrus flavors.

I picked this one up at the Aussie Products store for a few bucks but it can be had online in many places, including Amazon and [UK Goods](http://www.ukgoods.com).

_Special thanks to Aussie Products for the hookup on this one, even though I technically paid for it. If you're in the San Jose, CA area and are feeling that down under tingle, go check them out or visit [aussieproducts.com](http://aussieproducts.com)._
