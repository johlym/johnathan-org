“Rails Developer” has a nice ring to it, don't you think?

In my hunt to figure out where I want my career to head long term, I keep coming back to the idea of software development. I've told stories about how I had a rare opportunity a couple years back and I didn't take it. Well, this time I'm the one creating the opportunity.

Right now I'm working on a self-paced course through [Coder Manual](http://codermanual.com) and I'm having a great time. However, it may be billed as a complete “bootcamp” but the next stage for me really needs to be one-on-one with a touch of free-wheeling. It's easy to follow along and build the same stuff the instructor is building. Where the real learning takes place is when free flowing creativity starts to happen.

This is where [Bloc](http://bloc.io) comes in. A long-term coding bootcamp, [Bloc](http://bloc.io) covers front end, rails, and full stack development with the end goal of being job-ready as a junior ruby on rails developer.

I've considered other languages like Python, Java, Swift and Objective-C, but none of those really hit home for me what I want to do. Rails as a platform allows developers to build complex and fully-featured web applications that can do amazing things while not having to focus on the medial.

Looking forward to what's ahead.
