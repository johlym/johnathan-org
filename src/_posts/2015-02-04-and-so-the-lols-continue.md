Remember yesterday when I mentioned that AdBlock Plus was allowing companies to pay their way through the blocks to users? Turns out, that list is bigger than I led on. In fact, [it's down right stupid long](http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/02/over-300-businesses-now-whitelisted-on-adblock-plus-10-pay-to-play/).

> In an e-mail to Ars, AdBlock Plus Communications Manager Ben Williams wrote that currently, the browser extension has granted a pass to “over 300 sites/entities” out of “over 1,500 applicants” to the company's whitelist.

Damn. Remind me again the point of AdBlock Plus?
