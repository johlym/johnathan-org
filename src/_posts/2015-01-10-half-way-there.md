This site has served many purposes over the last couple of years, and none of them have really taken off. Looking back on how my routines have changed and what I am spending more time focusing on, I can really tell that at some point in the future that I can't determine (yet), this site will finally become a permanent and consistent place for me to write and share my voice and thoughts.

One thing I've always thought about doing is starting a full-on tech blog, but the work involved is greater than the amount of time I have to spend, right now. I'm sure that'll change in the future, and when it does, I'll revisit the idea. In the mean time, I'm content with this one property.

While thinking about how my routines have changed, I know I still have a small struggle with the weekends. Over the last few days, I've been writing early in the morning before I leave for work and it's been helping me start my day in a more gradual and stimulating fashion. The weekend is still a struggle though because subconsciously I know I don't have anywhere to be in particular so why should I bother getting up early? Since hindsight is always 20/20, I can tell my 8 hour-past self that I wouldn't feel like crap for sleeping 14 hours and my day wouldn't be half-wasted away. I could have done a ton of stuff in the 5-7 hours I could have had as extra if I stuck to the routine I set up during the week.

With any new habit, it takes time to break out of the old one and build up a new one, so tomorrow is always another opportunity to try again.

One of my end goals with this blog is to be able to write about one particular complete topic related to the previous day. I know there are so many different things that happen all the time that I could have enough content for years, but a lot of it I don't keep record of or even remember. I can't remember where I read it but a statistic stated that we only remember roughly 6% of what happened the day before. Maybe that number is higher, but I also remember that within a week, that number drops to 1%. I know I can agree on the second number because this time last weekend, I remember very little of what I was doing…

I don't want to just write about a random smattering of things, though. I want to keep it to topics I find interesting and relevant… stuff that describes myself and my interests, not just what I ate for breakfast, yesterday (oatmeal). It'll take a bit of time to build up, but I'll get there. Keeping my self writing everyday will help do that.
