Ars Technica:

> You might think being a science writer is a dream job, one that means spending all day learning new things about a seemingly endless sweep of interesting fields. And, to an extent, you'd be right. But in other ways, it's also a place where dreams go to die. Things you think should be fascinating—things that, in some cases, you've dreamed about knowing more about for much of your life—turn out to be staggeringly dull.

Their list is surprising. I would assume talking about all these things would be awesome. Turns out, not so much.
