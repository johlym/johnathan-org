From The Wall Street Journal:

>  …in some cases, Mr. Dorsey has weighed in on content decisions at the last minute or after they were made, sometimes resulting in changes and frustrating other executives and employees, according to people familiar with the matter.
> …
> Last month, after Twitter’s controversial decision to allow far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to remain on its platform, Mr. Dorsey told one person that he had overruled a decision by his staff to kick Mr. Jones off, according to a person familiar with the discussion. Twitter disputes that account and says Mr. Dorsey wasn’t involved in those discussions.

Twitter’s stance on racism (they love it–it means more ad money) and blatant disregard for abuse on the platform (they also love that) fall exactly in line with this story. I wouldn’t be surprised in the least bit if Dorsey was an actual racist. More likely though, he has fallen so deeply into the “white-guy-with-so-much-money-that-can-ignore-it-all-and-sleep-soundly” pit that there’s no changing his mind.

The company declined this allegation, because of course they did.
