CNBC:

> Snap’s shares have struggled to hold their value since its IPO early last year. At Thursday’s lowest point, Snap was off more than 40 percent from its debut price of $17 and more than 65 percent off its all-time intraday high of $29.44.

They’re down below $10 as of this morning. All I can do is chuckle.
