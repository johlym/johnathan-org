If there's one thing that people will never stop complaining about, it'll be ads on Facebook. Well, I take that back. They'll stop complaining when Facebook is out of business.

Have you ever wondered how advertisers ended up targeting you, as a Facebook user? I did, then I discovered a small feature that I don't think many know about.

The next time you see a Facebook ad you don't think is relevant to you, click that downward facing arrow in the top-right of the ad and click “Why am I seeing this?” You'll see something that looks like this:

This little prompt tells you exactly what you need to know. In my case, I've highlighted why I saw an advertisement about criminal record sealing. As someone without a criminal record, I needed to know their criteria. As it turns out, this advertiser thinks everyone that drinks whiskey is likely to have a record. Way to generalize.
