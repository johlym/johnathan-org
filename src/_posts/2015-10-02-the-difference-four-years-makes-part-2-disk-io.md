This is something I've been waiting to see for a long time. As you're aware, I've been using a four year old Macbook Pro for quite some time (placed the order in June 2011) and today I've finally made the upgrade to a 2015 of the same make and model.

The one thing I was excited to see the most above all else is the disk I/O speeds.

Let's compareâ€¦

Before:

After:

Big difference, eh? The former is a SATA 6Gb SSD (Toshiba 128GB) and the latter is a PCI-e SSD (256GB). My how times change.
