You have to kind of care about Starbucks and coffee shop-type music but this morning I strolled into Starbucks and when I went to pay with my Starbucks card via the app, I was able to get [the playlist for the music being played](https://open.spotify.com/user/starbucks/playlist/0LPsYH4hIRjLUKXuZd2vAt) at that location.

Turns out, it's a substantial one, too. Starbucks has a 559 song (at time of writing) playlist on Spotify. To get a better idea of the size, I marked the playlist to be available offline. Using a completely non-scientific measurement of free storage on my system, the playlist occupied just under 5GB at 320kbps quality (Extreme, as Spotify calls it).

As time passes, I'm finding my music tastes shifting in the casual sense. This might just push them over the edge. I'm also getting closer to 30. I wonder if they're relatedâ€¦
