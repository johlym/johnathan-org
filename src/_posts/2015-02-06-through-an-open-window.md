One thing I've never liked about being up early in the morning is how dark it is outside throughout the winter. It's hard getting up at 4AM and seeing nothing but the same darkness you saw when you went to bed the night before. Sure there's a lot of excitement to be had at night, but for those of us with responsibilities, that's just not an option. Instead I'm indoors, wondering what's going on in the wee hours of the morning.

Late night and early morning can lead to a lot of great inspiration for when my list of things to talk about is running on fumes. With my regular stents of barfing my brain onto the internet now (practically every day), I have to now take to task the idea that I'm also responsible for regular creative thinking.

What about the night is so interesting?

Why are people attracted to the darkness?

Are day-time clubs even a thing?

I ponder all of these things, and more on a regular basis. Personally, I've never been one to go to a night club. Don't get me wrong, I've been to night clubs before, and back then it was mildly amusing having some girl rub her sweaty butt crack on me; don't you think for one second that guys are the only ones that sweat.

Nowadays, it's not even remotely interesting. Perhaps it has something to do with the idea that I grew up and care about more substantial things in life. If I wanted to pay $20 to drink, listen to overly loud music, and look stupid, I could do that at home, for free. Just saying.



The night also harbors the second and third shift folks who keep the world running while we all sleep. I know this because I used to be one. Working 4PM to 1AM was awesome when I was 21, single, and caring little about getting up at noon every day. It was great. Leaving work at 1AM led to the most delicious Jack in the Box burgers anyone has ever tasted. They do something differently in the middle of the night because they tasted so much better. Maybe it was just my desire for greasiness in the middle of the night that made me feel that way.

All this pondering and reflecting on the night makes me wonder about a possible side project: regular stories about fictional people based on real people out being adventurous at night. Sounds like it could be good. One concern I have is how often I will be willing to stay up late at night and take notes. I sure as hell can't magically come up with stories. The tales have to have some sort of truth behind them; that's what makes them great! Otherwise, it's just another story.

Perhaps more brainstorming is on the wayâ€¦when the sun comes up.
