I haven't been feeling my best the last couple days so the level of snark is above average. Trying to keep it in line for this one from Buzzfeed:

Timothy Anselimo, a well-known video game player, was shot three times at a _Madden NFL 19_ tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, on Sunday, and his mother has said it is not clear if the 25-year-old will ever be able to play professional esports again.

On its face, it's tragic. Timothy was the victim of a truly terrible event that should have never happened. I have sympathy for his injuries but not so much that his opportunity to make a living is in jeopardy:

> “He's a righty and he has to hold the controls with his right hand,” Lopez said. “This is his life. He made it and he's alive but if he can't play and he can't work and he can't do this, his life will be changed forever.”

I suppose getting a regular job would change someones life.
