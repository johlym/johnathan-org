The most astute in the crowd will have noticed Weekly Wine hasn't been updated since issue five. I have a semi-decent reason for that and a peak at what I'm working on in its place.

When I started Weekly Wine, I didn't quite have the right idea for how much work it was going to require. Picking wine isn't in and of itself hard. Picking good wine can be a bit daunting. Unless you're already a seasoned wine vet, chances are your list of goto bottles isn't super long.

Mine surely wasn't. Through this excersize though, I've discovered a lot of great bottles and rekindled some love for existing ones.

Here's what I have planned for v2 of Weekly Wine.

It'll be moving to a more traditional blog format which features an email subscription component. The blog will serve as an archive for past recommendations. The goal with Weekly Wine isn't to necessarily have a new bottle to share with readers every week, but have enough bottles to pick from so readers have something fun to try each week.

I found myself a couple times getting the weekly wine recs in just under the deadline and that wasn't great pressure. I don't cope well with that kind of self-imposed pressure so I tend to punt stuff like that. This is why one issue dropped on a Friday.

If there's one thing I learned, it's that maintaining a weekly scheduled thing takes a lot more work than it sounds, and I don't envy those who do daily mailers.

I'm hoping to get this new incarnation of Weekly Wine up sometime in April. In the meantime, the original five issues will remain at [weekly.wine](http://weekly.wine).

Until next time!
