One thing I never did when I moved my blog to john.ly and away from jlyman.net was to add SSL. I had SSL set up and running on jlyman.net purely because of the low cost of entry. At $10/year, basic SSL gives great HTTPS encryption. Privacy is important, and while I don't take or give sensetive personal information, it's still a nice thing to have.

I added SSL to this domain last week and am thinking I made a great choice. Every site I fire up from now on will have it. It's hard to say no at $10 a yearâ€¦ I think I waste more than that on crap I end up throwing away.
