Kurt Wagner over at Recode:

>  Last Monday, we wrote: “No data collected through Portal — even call log data or app usage data, like the fact that you listened to Spotify — will be used to target users with ads on Facebook.”
> We wrote that because that's what we were told by Facebook executives.
> But Facebook has since reached out to change its answer: Portal doesn't have ads, but data about who you call and data about which apps you use on Portal can be used to target you with ads on other Facebook-owned properties.

Anyone who thought this would turn out differently is either living under a rock or has no idea what Facebook Portal even is. They make money by advertising stuff and to do that well, they need to know things about you. There's absolutely no chance Facebook will turn down an opportunity to be always on in your home and always sampling your life. No Facebook.com or Facebook app access required.

Granted, they didn't outright say they'll target you, but it's only a matter of time before “we could” turns into “we do.”
