I have been a fan of the Affinity product line from Serif since they first released Affinity Photo. As someone who has spent a decent amount of time working with desktop publishing tools some years ago, I got excited when I received the announcement that Affinity Publisher was now in beta and ready to be poked at by the general public.

Right away it's clear that Affinity Publisher carries the same design language and ease of use that Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer present to users immediately upon opening the app for the first time. I would expect this app to go head-to-head with Adobe InDesign and QuarkXPress and handily beat them out in the most common use cases.

If you're not a fan of Adobe's monthly, never-own-your-license methodology, that alone might be enough to switch. Adobe InDesign requires at least $30/month to access and QXP is $849 (or $399 if coming from InDesign). I'd imagine Affinity Publisher debuts at $49.99 given that both Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer are $49.99 each.

With the third product on the way, I can also see the three titles being released as a bundle for something like $129. At either price point, it's a killer deal.

Ashley Hewson is the Managing Director at Serif and when asked about the overall goal Serif had for their product line, she said:

>  From the earliest days of visualising the Affinity range, we planned an unrivalled trio of sleek, super-modern apps created to work with the latest technology â€“ ultra-fast, with stunning power and completely stripped of bloat.
> The final step towards realising that initial ambition will come with the launch of Affinity Publisher.
> It's an all-new app which we believe will revolutionise desktop publishing in the same way Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer have shaken up professional photo editing and vector graphic design.

I absolutely believe her. Affinity Publisher brings with it tier 1 publishing features like master pages, page spreads, linked resources, full CMYK support, and advanced typography management.

While in beta, there's bound to be some rough edges. Serif set up [a specific forum](https://forum.affinity.serif.com/index.php?/forum/62-affinity-publisher-beta-forums/) to discuss beta issues, so if you run into any, head there first.

The free beta is open to everyone and is available to download [here](https://affinity.serif.com/publisher) for Windows and macOS. an iPad version is coming later.
