As much as I try to stay current with technology, there's a part of me that just doesn't care if I check my phone all the time, or am constantly reading emails on the weekend. I know a lot of people keep up to date on the latest everything with every device they have and that's awesome. I just can't do that. However, there's one device that I really can't live without because it's become a gateway to the “Quick-Check-to-See-if-the-World-Has-Burned-Down” reality: my iPhone.

I'm quite sure the list of people that say they couldn't live without their phone is staggering. Hell, Instagram is a phone-only thing and look at how many people share what they're eating on regular basis! If people stopped caring so much about their phones and making sure everything that was going on was going through their phone, Instagram would shut down. It's likely that twitter would take a big hit, too. Facebook… meh. People are still butthurt about the unbundling of services that Facebook did recently, because they don't have anything else to be upset about. They're rebelling against the system by using their browser or their computer as if that'll do anything. You go guys… way to stick it to the man.

Don't get me wrong, I love having my phone around with me all the time, but it's more of a just-in-case-something-happens kind of need. I might be listening to podcasts while I travel to and from work every day, but we've been able to do that for quite some time, before smartphones were a thing (remember the iPod?) so that doesn't count as a dire need. I listen to music, too, but that also falls under what I just described. I might check twitter every now and then or watch Facebook all morning but that just drains me. Have you ever sat on twitter reading people's 140-character-or-less thoughts and NOT felt drained or depressed afterwards? The world sucks nuts and I can only read about it for a little bit.

The world used to be a simpler place. Cats used to sit inside cannons like it's no big deal. You can tell a lot about a time period by whether you have a cat that's willing to loiter around artillery. Those days were nice.

For all I don't use my iPhone for, though, if I didn't have it with me, I'd feel disconnected, I'll admit. It's become more of a security blanket when I'm moving between point A and point B. I, and likely society as a whole, have been trained to think that if I leave my house without my phone, something bad might happen and I won't be able to call for help! I wonder how people in the 90s even survived.

I think if I absolutely had to, could resort to a dumb phone. Apple still makes iPods, so all my smart tools could just migrate to that device. I'd have iMessage wherever I had wifi and text messaging on my dumb phone. Turns out, though, that I'd still end up paying an arm and a leg for service. The difference of $20 for data isn't worth the downgrade. On the flip side, the uncharge of $20 for data to have a smartphone is paltry.

Perhaps one day I'll see if I can go a whole day without my smartphone. I have a ton of technology around me at home, and a ton more at work, so really there'll only be roughly three hours out of the day where I'm in that disconnected state that won't allow me to get the latest tweets that I hate or read emails the bleeding freaking second they arrive.

But that's unlikely.
