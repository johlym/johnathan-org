Apple announced a host of updated bits of hardware at today's event in Brooklyn. Here's my recap on the important bits. Let's dive right in, or jump to:

- [Mac Mini](#macmini)
- [MacBook Air](#macbookair)
- [iPad Pro](#ipadpro)
- [Apple Pencil](#pencil)

# Mac Mini

The last update to the Mac Mini was in 2014, and it was underwhelming to say the least. Today's announcement is a welcome refresh to those who still enjoy the small-form-factor Apple desktop computer.

## Tech Specs

- **Processor** : The Mac Mini comes in two main flavors, a 4-core 3.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i3 and a 6-core 3.0GHz Core i5 (with Turbo Boost up to 4.1GHz). Both can be upgraded to a 3.2GHz 6-core Intel Core i7 with Turbo Boost up to 4.6GHz.
- **Memory** : 8GB of 2666MHz DDR4 SO-DIMM memory is standard and both can be upgraded to 16, 32, or 64GB respectively.
- **Storage** : Depending on the model, storage options start at 128GB or 256GB of PCIe SSD storage and can be upgraded to a max of 2TB.
- **Graphics** : No configurability, just the Intel UHD Graphics 630 chip. Definitely not for gaming.

  - Power
  - 1x Ethernet
    - 1GBase-T or 10GBase-T
  - 4x Thunderbolt 3 (40gbps) / USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 (10gbps)
  - 1x HDMI 2.0
  - 2x USB-A 3.0 (5gbps)

# Macbook Air

{% cloudinary_img "MacBook Air family 10302018", "macbook_air_family.jpg "macbook\_air\_family.jpg"", "large" %}

We haven't seen the MacBook Air receive a meaningful update in even more years than the Mac Mini. Until today, it rocked a 1280×800 non-retina display (and if you really want to punish yourself, you can still buy it). This version keeps the hard function keys but brings over Touch ID (and the T2) chip from the MacBook Pro line.

Here's what's up with the new model:

## Tech Specs

- **Processor** : 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz.
- **Memory** : 8GB of 2133MHz LPDDR3 memory, upgradable to 16GB.
- **Storage** : Depending on the model, storage options start at 128GB or 256GB of PCIe SSD storage and can be upgraded to a max of 1.5TB.
- **Graphics** : No configurability, just the Intel UHD Graphics 630 chip. Definitely not for gaming.

  - 2x Thunderbolt 3 40Gbps (USB-C 3.1 Gen 2, unto 10Gbps) ports.
    - Both support charging.
  - There's also a headphone jack.

- **Wireless:** 802.11ac WiFi and Bluetooth 4.2.
- **Display** : 13.3″ 2560×1600 Retina display without TrueTone. This is the same size and resolution as the 13″ MacBook Pro.
- **Battery:** Up to 12 hours on the Web, 13 hours of movie playback, 30 days standby thanks to a 50.3 watt-hour battery and a 30-watt USB-C power adapter
- **Colors:** Gold, Silver, Space Gray

# Apple Pencil (2nd Generation)

It's cool to see the Apple Pencil get some love. As a first-generation Pencil owner, the changes they've made are quite welcome, but some of them aren't noticeable unless you're also using it with the 3rd-generation 11″ or 12.9″ iPad Pro.

- Touch surface that supports double-tapping.
- Magnetic attachment, charging, and pairing to 3rd-generation iPad Pro.

The 2nd-generation Apple Pencil is available to [pre-order now](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU8F2/apple-pencil-2nd-generation) for $129.
