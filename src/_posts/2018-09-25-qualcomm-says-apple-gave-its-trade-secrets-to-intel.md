Ina Fried at Axios:

> In the new filings, Qualcomm says that, at Apple’s request, it allowed the iPhone maker deep access to its software and tools, but with strict limits on how those products could be used. Rather than just use it to improve the performance and functioning of Qualcomm chips, the company alleges that Apple used it to understand how the modem works and to help Intel improve their chips.

I smell a company that’s just mad Apple’s not working with them anymore and now Intel has massively improved radios. The claims of theft are crazy, though. That’s a massive accusation to make.
