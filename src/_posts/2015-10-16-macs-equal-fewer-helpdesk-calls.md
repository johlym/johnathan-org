I’ve been a mac user for four years and I can honestly say that I’ve spent less time needing to maintain my systems than any Windows PC I’ve never owned.

It’s not really news that IBM rolling out the usage of Macs for its employees, but one thing that’s made at least small headlines is that after rolling out 1900 Macs a week, IBM made an [announcement](http://www.jamfsoftware.com/blog/mac-ibm-zero-to-30000-in-6-months/) during a talk at the [JAMF Nation User Conference](http://www.jamfsoftware.com/blog/mac-ibm-zero-to-30000-in-6-months/) that during their deployments and thereafter, the number of Mac users who’ve contacted their tech support for assistance has been [several times](http://www.jamfsoftware.com/blog/mac-ibm-zero-to-30000-in-6-months/) less than their PC counterparts.

> To much fanfare from the crowd, Previn said that IBM is deploying 1,900 Macs per week and currently have 130,000 Macs and iOS devices in the hands of users. And all of these devices are supported by a total of 24 help desk staff members, meaning that each staff member effectively supports 5,375 employees. One stat that particularly stood out was that 5% of Mac users call the help desk, compared to 40% of PC users.
