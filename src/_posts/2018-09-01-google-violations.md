Dave Winer [reminded me](http://scripting.com/2018/09/01.html#a165335) why I opted to never use AdSense again:

> Emails like this from Google about “violations” on my website are really disturbing, esp since I don’t run any Google ads on my site. I wish they’d STFU about violations, or say what the violations are. I always can use a good laugh. Their email is a violation of my independence. Fuck off.

Yes. ?

Additionally, I’m told this blog is not fit for Google AdSense, which is fine. The last time I used AdSense was 2012 to 2013, I think. I was kicked out of the program without evidence I did anything wrong, but couldn’t argue against it. Without knowing what I did, I had no idea what to fix. Google always has the last say when it comes to their services and while that’s not particularly unique, they do a great job of reminding us from time to time that we’re at their mercy and we should consider ourselves grateful that they’re letting us play in their holy sandbox.

I brought the Carbon ad network (under the ownership of BuySellAds) on board last week, an email I was genuinely excited to receive that email. They’ve been great to work with so far, have only a handful of rules, and the advertisers they allow are top-notch. As far as serving banner ads goes, Carbon is the limit. The rest of the revenue will be made up of affiliate links for stuff I actually believe in (and use) and site memberships. Dave has no ads, and that’s entirely fine–and his prerogative. I think the right network can make a world of difference.

Plus, I’m not subjecting my visitors to unknown levels of ad-tracking. BSA/Carbon does a bit of it, yes, in order to inform their advertisers how their ads performed, but that’s about it. I appreciate clean and simple advertising and wish the rest of the world would get on board. Even a single tear would not be shed if AdSense went away tomorrow.

I can dream.
