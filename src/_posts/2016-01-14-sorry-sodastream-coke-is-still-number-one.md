There's something that's utterly delicious about brand-named Coca Cola that my Sodastream just can't replace. Sorry, but the syrup masterminds in Tel Aviv just can't fool me.

I don't necessarily think it's the fact that it's in a can. I think it has to do with the syrup.

Yeah, I know, big revelation there, for sure. Sue me.

While I write this, I'm taking the occasional swig from a can of Coke Zero, the Coke product that tastes the most like Sodastream's Cola flavor. I think, after it's all said and done, what it comes down to is the “natural flavors.” Whatever they are, they're made from a natural source and turned into a chemical of some kind that makes sense for a production line.

There's also something about the crispness that I just can't seem to master with the Sodastream. Perhaps it's the level of carbonation.

Whatever the differences are, I'm sure I could find answers if I searched the Internet. Since I'm writing this, I didn't, and I don't plan on it.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a soda to finish.
