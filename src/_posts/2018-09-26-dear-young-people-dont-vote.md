_Everything's fine the way it is._

Young people make up 31% of the electorate ([as of 2016](https://www.npr.org/2016/05/16/478237882/millennials-now-rival-boomers-as-a-political-force-but-will-they-actually-vote)) and always say they'll vote, but they [generally don't](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/04/10/young-people-say-they-plan-on-voting-in-november-but-they-usually-dont/). This ad is a great demonstration of reverse psychology, but is also painfully true.

The government would look a lot different if the population that makes up 1/3 of the electorate by itself actually voted.
