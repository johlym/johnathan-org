Looks like it’s the end for Back to My Mac. The core of this product was its ability to allow you to share files and screen access between macs, regardless of where they were located.

I can’t say I used it at all so my feelings are minimal. The alternatives make me a bit said, though, since they’re essentially the unbundled (and expensive and also not updated) equivalent. Apple suggests using iCloud Drive and Screen Sharing. If you need more capability, Apple Remote Desktop is an option, though it’s $80 and hasn’t been updated in over a year.

Something to keep in mind is how well Back to My Mac worked in the first place. I can’t remember anyone saying especially glowing things about it.
