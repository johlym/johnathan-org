This is [a great explainer from Mac Rumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/24/apple-store-flaw-t-mobile-pins-exposed/) on what happened with T-Mobile and AT&T's data leak:

> Accessing the T-Mobile PINs on Apple's website involved a brute force attack where a hacker used software to input multiple different numeric combinations to guess the proper one.

The article goes on to say that Asurion had a similar issue that exposed some AT&T customers, too.
