Rom Amadeo writing in his 19,000(!) word [Android 9 review](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/09/android-9-pie-thoroughly-reviewed/):

> Android 9 includes an experimental gesture navigation system and built-in notch support. There’s also a new screenshot editor, lots of improvements for text selection, and changes to the way rotation works.

> Under the hood, more changes have come, too, with AI-powered battery usage controls, new rules for Play Store developers, and changes to how apps get distributed.

I think it’s pretty fair to say the “notch” that everyone made fun of Apple for doing is now a mainstream thing. Such is the punishment of being first.
