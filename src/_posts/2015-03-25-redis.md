I'm always looking for interesting things I can do to my site and the series underneath if it means providing some sort of benefit, even if just a small one. I also like learning, so I got the best of both worlds when I took the time a few days ago to set up [Redis](http://redis.io) as a front-end cache for WordPress.

Installing it was dead simple. I already had the PHP [PECL module](http://pecl.php.net/package/redis) installed, so all I needed to do was [install it via apt-get](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-redis), install a [WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/redis-cache/), and I'm on my way. It took less than ten minutes. Way cool.

Page loads drops by about half. I like that.
