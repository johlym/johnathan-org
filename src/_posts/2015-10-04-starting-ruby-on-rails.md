I've started learning Ruby on Rails. One thing I want for myself in the next year or so is to do more software development. As an added bonus, if my career shifted into that type of work, I wouldn't mind.

I chose Rails because of it's completeness. It's not just a languageâ€”ruby is the language. It's a complete framework for building any kind of web app you can think of.

I have a lot of ideas on web apps I want to build and some of them could turn into real things that could make money. In order to be able to do that, though, I have to have a platform to build upon. I think Rails is it.
