Today is the 55th day of the year, and I've made it to 100. I'm not quite sure what the rest of the year holds. As I sit here with my coffee &nbsp;like I do most mornings, I'm thinking about my first real stent at blogging, the first goals I set2 for myself, and when I changed up those goals shortly after because I ended up blowing through them.

March is coming around soon, so it'll be time to make slight adjustments, as always. I'm excited for the next 100 posts. Let's see what happens!
