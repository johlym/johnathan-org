What plans start today?

I'm guilty of this. The idea of 'why do today what you can put off until tomorrow.' It's a terrible way to think and it leads to more procrastination.

My struggle with this rears its ugly head even more now as I'm simultaneously going to school, doing job training, and searching for a new job in a place I've never really been to (outside of a few hours). I definitely don't have the advantage of being local. I also don't have the advantage of being a brain child or software development prodigy so in an area where not only tech jobs are a dime a dozen, but people to fill them are a nickel a dozen, my work is cut out for me.

I'm not saying it's impossible: leads are starting to trickle in. I'm saying it's an uphill battle and because I still have time, it's easy for me to say I'll work on it tomorrow, or this weekend. Turns out I don't have that much time. A couple months and change isn't much time and I have a hard deadline to meet. I have a backup plan but even that's not a for sure.

With so much riding on this, it's not something I can hold off doing.
