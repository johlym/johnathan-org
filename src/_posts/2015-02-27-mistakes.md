We all make mistakes, right? That's not just me?

> Mistakes are the portals of discovery. ~ James Joyce

To err is to be human, and even though we're always striving for greatness, sometimes we falter. It's what happens when you've hit bottom that counts.

Whatever you do, don't give up. That's a mistake all in itself.
