What’s the point of having ad blocking software if it doesn’t block any ads? Good question.

[From the Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/2/7963577/google-ads-get-through-adblock):

> Some of the web’s biggest companies have been paying to get around Adblock Plus, according to [a new report from _Financial Times_](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/80a8ce54-a61d-11e4-9bd3-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=intl#axzz3Qbj7oEjB). Microsoft’s Bing search ads and [Taboola’s “recommended links” box](http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/22/5639892/how-weaponized-clickbait-took-over-the-web) are among the ads that are currently slipping through Adblock Plus’s filter, and _FT_ confirms that it’s the intentional result of a paid deal between the makers of Adblock and the owners of the ads.

Sweet.
