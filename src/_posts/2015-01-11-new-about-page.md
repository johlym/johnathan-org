I was able to stick to my routine this morning and sat down to craft my About page. I've never really spent much time working on it so reflecting on who I am and how I got here was actually very helpful in deciding what to write and what to share. Looking back, I can't really think of a good reason why I didn't write one before, except for the idea that I just didn't take it very seriously. 2015 is full of changes, including this one. Now if you'll excuse me, I need some coffee!
