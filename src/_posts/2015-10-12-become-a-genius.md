We all want to be smarter. Thomas Oppong put together a list of 33 Web sites that we all can use to become geniuses. (He did, but it was [taken down](https://lumendatabase.org/notices/11700921#))

A few of my favorites from his list:

1. University of the People – having educational opportunities that reach beyond online video courses is fantastic.
2. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) – this one is always on every list I make regarding top educational resources.
3. [Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/) – knowing more about how the markets work and personal finance can _never_ be a bad thing.
4. [Mental Floss](http://mentalfloss.com/) – great for learning about some of the cooler topics science, culture, and society.
5. [In a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q) – while not technically on the list, this YouTube channel put together by some german graphic artists covers a wide array of topics in a way anyone can understand, with awesome visuals.
6. [C.G.P. Grey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w) – also not technically on the list, however as an educational YouTube resource, Grey tops that list, if there is one.

Check out the rest of Thomas' list if you're curious. I recommend you check out every link he listed.
