Using their heavily-watermarked Apple Watch Series 4 hero image,[9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/10/kuo-iphone-6-1-ipad-pro-usb-c-macbook-touch-id-apple-watch-ecg/) has a semi-fresh list of speculations, including the notion that the next iPad will use USB-C and the middle-cheaper iPhone will be called the iPhone Xr. This runs contrary to [another rumor](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/09/09/iphone-xc-iphone-xs-plus-china-mobile-leak/) (based on Chinese carrier slides) that say it'll be called the iPhone Xc.

We'll find out on Wednesday.
