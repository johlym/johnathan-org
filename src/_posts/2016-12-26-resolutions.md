I’ve never been a fan of New Year’s Resolutions. There’s something about creating a todo list that for some reason can’t start until January 1st nor was it even thought of until someone asked _do you have any resolutions for the new year?_

I suppose I should clarify. I don’t have a problem with _read one book per week in 2017_. My beef is with _read more books in 2017_. The difference there is the latter is vague and lacking substance. That’s no way to live.

The latter is much better and I’d argue it’s not even a resolution at all, but a goal. Resolutions are vague and easy to get out of. Tight goals with small checkpoints along the way to measure progress are where it’s at and where your head should be at, too.

Instead of making resolutions this year, sit down right now, today, and set a couple goals for yourself. A goal of mine is to blog five days a week (Monday-Friday) throughout the new year. It worked incredibly well for me as a part of my morning routine when I seriously started pumping words into this blog January 2015.

Another goal of mine is to read one book every two weeks. Every week sounds better, sure, but I’d argue one week vs two isn’t what’s important. What’s important in that goal is I’m reading more, learning more, and consuming the ideas, thoughts, and teachings of others much more frequently.

What are your goals for 2017?
