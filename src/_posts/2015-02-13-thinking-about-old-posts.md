Looking back on old posts isn't really something that I do on a regular basis. Once I'm all set and posting my words, that's pretty much it. I have a good reason, though. If I started going back and reviewing my past posts, I feel like I might end up second guessing my work before I post it in the first place.

There's one time I go back and review that doesn't have to do with copy editing. When I feel like formatting suffered or something just didn't turn out right, then I'll for sure review it. If I'm talking about a particular topic and I find a link to share after the fact, I might link it in the post later.

At the end of the day, the first time around is usually the most genuine with writing, the words we say, or any mixture of the two. I try to keep it that way as much as possible.
