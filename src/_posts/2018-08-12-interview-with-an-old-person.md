By way of [One Foot Tsunami](https://onefoottsunami.com/), I came across [this Slate article](https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/08/interview-with-an-old-person-eleanor-tom-jaynes-91-on-living-in-hawaii-during-pearl-harbor.html). Slate sits down with 91-year-old Eleanor Tom Jaynes.

> When we realized what was happening, we put the radio on. They told us to hurry up, that there was an attack and that we needed to quickly find something to pin on ourselves with our name and our address so they would know who we were in case we were lost or bombed. And that was scary, to think that we had to be protected, that something could happen to us. That night, the military told us to black out our windows and stay inside, not to turn lights on at night at all if we could, just use our flashlights, but not to use them very much. And they said always be prepared to run. But that was stupid, because where can you run in the island?

Oof.

This was such a good read.
