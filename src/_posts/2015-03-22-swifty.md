I'm always looking for new ways to learn how to code. Up until recently, I had no idea where to really start with Swift, the language used to craft iOS apps and games that mades its appearance in iOS 8.

A few days ago, I came across Swifty, a free app (with a couple in-app purchases) that teaches you the basics of iOS programming. I recommend you go check it out on the App Store. It's a great way to get started and with no cost for entry, if you don't like it, you're not out any money. It's available for both the iPhone and iPad.

([Mimo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mimo-learn-to-code/id1133960732?mt=8) is a modern-day alternative.)
