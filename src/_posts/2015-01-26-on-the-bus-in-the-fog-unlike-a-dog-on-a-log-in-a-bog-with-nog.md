This is the first time I've tried to write a post on the bus. There's a lot of free time to be had on the bus, that I could just waste reading ArsTechnica articles or scrolling Facebook. But after my recap on the finicky relationship I have with my iPhone I feel like it's necessary to look into putting it to better use.

First off, let me be clear. I don't have any special writing apps to craft posts for when I'm in a bus in the fog writing for my blog (or any other alliterative, Dr. Seuss-type wordplays). I'm using the basic Notes app that comes with all Apple devices these days. I'm not even bothering to check my spelling too much as autocorrect seems to be doing a pretty good job on its own. Now granted if my word choice ends up being a total crapfest, then I feel like I need to go back and update it.

Along with the Notes app comes the [WordPress app from Automattic](https://appsto.re/us/i9Mau.i). It's how I interface with my site from both my iPhone and iPad.

Second, I don't find it necessary to spend every waking moment writing, although it is enjoyable. I'm sure if I tried hard enough I could find enough stuff to talk about during the day to write non stop for two people.

Third, what's a blog post anyway but a digital journal entry? All I'm doing is putting my thoughts on digital paper and sharing them. I understand the recourse of the idea that once it's on the Internet it's there forever.

At some point, someone will want to sit next to me and hopefully I'll be close to the end. There's nothing I hate more than someone peeking over my shoulder trying to see what I'm up to. I get passing glances and whatnot, stuff happens. I can't expect someone to never catch a glance of my kickass high score in Candy Crush.

Now if you'll excuse me, I have to clear my autocorrect dictionary after all the new crap words it seems to have recorded after I wrote this.

PS: I might have seemed a bit ramble. That's just how I write and think on a moments notice. I wrote this post more so to prove a point that to myself that I can write wherever I am. In the future, I think I'll have to procure one of those keyboard iPad cases. A small screen makes my thumbs hurt.
