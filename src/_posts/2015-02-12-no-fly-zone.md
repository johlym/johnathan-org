[This](http://noflyzone.org) is [good news](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/02/noflyzone-database-will-tell-drones-not-to-fly-over-your-house/) for fans of privacy.

> Yesterday a new website and database launched called [NoFlyZone.org](http://NoFlyZone.org), which invites people to enter their home address to prevent amateur drone pilots from zooming over their property, GoPro running. The database is maintained by a team of 10 people based in El Segundo, California, and led by Ben Marcus, a private pilot and drone operator.

I have a pretty good idea what organizations won't be using this database.
