Missy Ryan and Dan Lamothe [writing for The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-military-parade-may-cost-three-times-more-than-first-estimates/2018/08/16/15159b44-a17e-11e8-93e3-24d1703d2a7a_story.html):

> Col. Rob Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the parade, which President Trump ordered this year as a tribute to American military might, could take place next year.

> “The Department of Defense and White House have been planning a parade to honor America’s military veterans and commemorate the centennial of World War I,” Manning said. “We originally targeted November 10, 2018 for this event but have now agreed to explore opportunities in 2019.”

> Manning provided no reason for the apparent postponement, which came amid a spate of news reports that the event, which is expected to include aircraft, vehicles, period uniforms and symbols of U.S. power, could cost up to $92 million, far more than originally estimated.

I’ll say it now. I’ll bet $100 they end up cancelling it or postponing it “indefinitely.”If that happens, I’ll donate the money to charity.
