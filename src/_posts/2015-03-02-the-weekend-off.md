I took the weekend off from blogging. It's the first time in a while that I haven't posted something, even just a link. I wanted to take time and focus on myself and personal enrichment. Because I'm looking for a new job since we're moving, it was fitting that I spend most of my time in that category, including education. I spent all weekend working on my CCNA and sprucing up my Linux deployment skills. It's nothing too exciting, but I did learn that NodeJS is a little memory leaker, that's for sure.

I started a dev blog running Ghost, just for kicks, and let it sit. It gets zero traffic, but NodeJS keeps using more memory. I feel it's one of those things that'll eventually use as much as it can and deal with the repercussions later. I am not thrilled. I'll keep an eye on it.

Needless to say I'm back on the horse for the week ahead. Next weekend will likely yield the same set of tasks, but I might sneak in a post or two.
