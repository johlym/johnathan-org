It's about that time of year when I look back on the posts that attracted the most eyeballs. Some of the most popular pieces of content this year were also the most popular last year, too. Admittedly, not much of this was actually from this year. By my count, half of these posts came from 2016 and 2017. I didn't get back into blogging hardcore until the last 1/4th of 2018.

Here are the top 10 most popular posts on this blog based on the number of views in the last year:

**#10** [**PowerPort Mini: The Charging Device Apple Should Have Made**](/powerport-mini-the-charging-device-apple-should-have-made/)

![](/content/images/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/powerport_size_comparison_1-1024x768.jpeg)

When I got my hands on yet another awesome Anker product, I was almost certain I'd enjoy it. True to form, Anker built a charging brick that is a bit larger than Apple's standard 5w unit but provides so much more power, it's almost a no-brainer. Each port is good for minimum 6 watts at 1.2 amps or one port is good for 12 watts at 2.4 amps. It won't break any speed records, especially compared to larger 18 and 30 watt chargers, but for its size [and price (2-pack for $16)](https://amzn.to/2oKPv6A) I don't know if it gets much better.

**#9** [**Affinity Publisher Beta**](/affinity-publisher-beta/)

![](/content/images/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Publisher-publication-1024x576.jpeg)

It was especially neat to see Affinity coming out with another killer desktop creative application to give Adobe a run for its money. Even though Publisher is still in beta, it's extremely stable and worth taking a look at if you have some time.

**#8** [**Add RTMP Support to Nginx Installed From Apt**](/add-rtmp-support-to-nginx-installed-from-apt/)

For the third year, this post makes its way onto my top 10 list. There seems to be just enough people out there–especially in the Raspberry Pi community–that want to stream video and ran into a lot of the same problems I have.

**#7** [**Fighting ffmpeg**](/fighting-ffmpeg/)

Also in its third year, my struggles with ffmpeg don't go un-noticed in the linux/Raspberry Pi community.

**#6** [**MacPaw's CleanMyMac X Review**](/macpaws-cleanmymac-x-review/)

![](/content/images/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/cmmx_system-1024x646.jpeg)

There hasn't been a day when I wasn't a fan of keeping my computers fresh and clean. MacPaw makes great software, and their newest version of CleanMyMac is no exception. It's entirely worth the price, and if you're a Setapp user, download it right now. If you're not, go [pick it up](https://johnathan.org/cleanmymacx) anyway.

**#5** [**Linode vs Digital Ocean: A Three-Round VPS Benchmark Showdown**](/linode-vs-digital-ocean-a-three-round-vps-benchmark-showdown/)

This was a fun post to write. I've hopped back and forth between the two providers a couple times over the years, and it was good to see just how each of them shined. Since both are equally priced, a lot of it comes down to &nbsp;one part workload and one part personal preference. Take a look at some of the benchmark results for yourself and see what makes the most sense for you.

**[#4 Phone, Wallet, Keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9N6_Tj9u2U)**

<iframe loading="lazy" title="Adam Sandler: 100% Fresh | Phone Wallet Keys Official Music Video [HD] | Netflix Is A Joke" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9N6_Tj9u2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

Adam Sandler was never one of my favorite comedians, but sharing this video seemed to be a hit with a lot of folks.

**#3** [**Fixing Browsersync Not Reloading**](/fixing-browsersync-not-reloading/)

I posted this in December 2017 so it never had the opportunity to make its way to the top that year, but I imagine had I shared it many months earlier, it would have.

**#2** [**Live Streaming with Hardware Acceleration using a Raspberry Pi and RTMP/HLS**](/live-streaming-with-hardware-acceleration-using-a-raspberry-pi-and-rtmp-hls/)

The third of four of my posts to make this list for the 3rd time. This is one of the series on my struggles in figuring out how to stream video from a Raspberry Pi to a couple different locations. Specifically, this part involved tackling hardware-accelerated streaming.

**#1** [**Attempting to Stream a Webcam to an RTMP Server**](/attempting-to-stream-a-webcam-to-an-rtmp-server/)

This was my original attempt at streaming video from a webcam to an RTMP server and the fourth of my 2016 posts to make it on this list for the third time.
