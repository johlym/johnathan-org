Apple World Today has a [quick piece on dumping flash](http://www.appleworld.today/blog/2015/8/5/it-may-be-time-to-eradicate-flash-from-your-mac-heres-how). If you need it, I feel bad for you. If you don’t need it, get rid of it. Adobe Flash has been riddled with holes almost since day one and has never gotten better. It’s 2015 and with the level of intricacy front-end UI frameworks provide, there’s no need for it. Flash needs to go away for good.

If you’re like me, you’ve already dumped it. I keep Google Chrome around just in case and if Flash is an absolute must.
