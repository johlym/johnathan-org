From Facebook:

>  Facebook's Ad Archive is a searchable database. It includes ads related to politics and issues of national importance that have run on Facebook or Instagram.
> This report is a weekly summary of the archive and includes data for ads that have been viewed by people in the US for the time period selected above.
> Making this report available to the public is part of Facebook's efforts to increase transparency in advertising.

A step in the right direction, for sure!
