[This is too perfect](https://boybyebot.com).

As someone who’s back in the dating world again, after almost six years out, I’m thoroughly amused by this.

I’m half-tempted to talk to this chatbot by texting 1–626–466–3293, though I’ll take my dose of amusement [from the site, itself](https://boybyebot.com).

I’ll be on the look out for a female version of this. Also be right back while I go check my contacts list ?
