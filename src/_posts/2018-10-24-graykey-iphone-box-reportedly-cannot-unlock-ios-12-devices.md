In a not surprising turn of events, it’s reported that the GrayKey box used by law enforcement to brute-force their way into your phone does not work with iOS 12 devices.

From Forbes:

> Multiple sources familiar with the GrayKey tech tell Forbes the device can no longer break the passcodes of any iPhone running iOS 12 or above. On those devices, GrayKey can only do what’s called a “partial extraction,” sources from the forensic community said. That means police using the tool can only draw out unencrypted files and some metadata, such as file sizes and folder structures.

I consider this a net win. This is what the court system and warrants are for.
