I'm always looking for new places to discover great services and products. Last night Crozdesk followed me on Twitter and I couldn't help but check them out and see what they offer. Really, I check out just about anyone that follows me on twitter. I'm by no means a superstar on the social network so I have time for things like that.

Crozdesk is a place to find a company, service, or product offering to fulfill a need you might have in various spaces, be it web design, hosting, social media, marketing, or anything relatively similar.

Their offering list is small-ish but I see it growing quickly as there's no charge for submitting your product or service to the site. If you're an indie developer or a small startup that has something cool, this would be the place to share it and let the community rate and offer their opinion on it.
