> It seems like the company is starting to shift its focus, if only a little bit. Instead of forming links people can use to reach new heights in their careers, LinkedIn is encouraging people to actually — get this — talk to the people in their circles.

While these companies may be putting Slack “in their crosshairs” doesn't mean they're a good shot.
