For 2019, one of my “goals” if you will is to spend more time noting more of the resources and tools I find valuable. The first category I'm targeting has to do with WordPress. Over the last 10 years of using WordPress in various capacities, I've seen, tested, tinkered with, and used more than a few WordPress themes, both free and for money.

In that time, I've used a lot of themes from big names like Elegant Themes and Genesis, and they're fantastic products. This tweet from Tom McFarlin got me thinking about the smaller shops and independent developers:

with all of the theme shops being acquired by hosts, what are some of your favorite niché shops? (i'm still a fan of [@thethemefoundry](https://twitter.com/thethemefoundry?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw))

Here's my list of some of my favorite smaller/indie (or niché as Tom put it ?) WordPress theme developers/shops.

- [Elma Studio](https://elmastudio.de/en)
- [ThemeFoundry](https://www.cssigniter.com)
- [Organic Themes](https://organicthemes.com)
- [ThemeTrust](https://themetrust.com/wordpress-themes/)
- [Kriesi](https://kriesi.at)
- [Muffin Group](https://muffingroup.com)
- [Ancora Themes](http://ancorathemes.com)
- [Artbees](http://artbees.net)
- [ThemeIsle](https://themeisle.com)
- [CSSIgniter](https://www.cssigniter.com)
- [FloThemes](https://flothemes.com/)

For every shop I listed, I know there are three more that would probably make the cut. These are just the ones I'm most familiar with and would recommend to WordPress users looking for high quality product.

[ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net) and [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com) often have high quality products from indie developers, too, so their marketplaces are always worth checking out, too.
