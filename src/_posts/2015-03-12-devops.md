It's not news anymore, but I thought it'd be worth mentioning real quick before I continue. I'm moving in the next couple months. In fact, as I write this, I have less than two months. The week of May 10th is when we're slated to pack up our house and shift it south two states. That might not seem like a lot, but I've never lived outside of the Seattle area, let alone a thousand miles away.

With that in mind, I just wanted to reflect for a minute on my job hunting.

There's one thing that will always be in the back of my mind no matter where I'm looking for a job: competition. The economy is either doing well or poorly, depending on which political side you stand, but that doesn't affect the number of people looking for a job. I'm specifically talking about the number of people looking for a a tech job, in a tech hub known as the Bay Area.

Don't get me wrong, there are a load of opportunities available, but there's a trend with a lot of them: if you're a college graduate who can program anything with your eyes closed, you're hired. That's what's in nowadays. I'm not one of those people, and I'm ok with that. I don't know if I'll ever be a die-hard software developer. I like backends. I guess we can refer to that as DevOps, a term that until about 2010, was probably just made up mumbo jumbo.

DevOps is a blend of software development and behind-the-scenes operations stuff. Think about the guys who make the internal tools in your company that allow you to do what you do. Those are DevOps guys. If you're a software developer, think about the guys that made all the tools you use to validate, build, and test. In some shops, those are done in houseâ€¦ by the DevOps guys.

DevOps is a field that's quite popular. You don't have to be a wizard in a given language, but you need to know your stuff. There's a lot of thinking on your feet and new challenges will always arise.

This is where I want to be. I have a really great idea in my mind on a platform that gives you the power of DevOps without needing a ton of staff and man hours to make your backend needs happen.

I hope to have something launched in the next five years. That'd be really exciting for me.
