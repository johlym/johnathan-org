There is a newer version of this product available [here](https://amzn.to/2NPT09L) that uses the air vent, instead. The reviewed version has been discontinued.

There's one problem I haven't been able to solve 100% effectively thus far and that's finding a way to hold my phone in my car without 1) using my hands and 2) placing it somewhere loosely. As I was pondering how I could solve this a couple weeks ago, I got word Anker wanted to ship me something that could potentially solve the problem.

Enter the Anker Universal Magnetic Car Mount.

Billed as a simple and sturdy solution to the dilemma I face, I was eager to give it a try.

The premise is simple. The mount aheres to your dashboard and attaches to your phone magnetically. In the box comes a couple adhesive magnet plates to attach to your devices.

Really, that's it. It seems pretty simple.

Except it didn't quite turn out that way.

As much as I wanted to really like this product, I just couldn't. The ahesive on the mount was poor and thus wouldn't stick to any useful surface in my car. There were a few places it _did_ stick, but they weren't easily accessible and seemed just as unhelpful as not having the mount at all.

Attaching the magnetic plate was easy but getting it off was a challenge. Anker suggests using floss(!) or fishing wire(!!) to remove it. I don't know about you but I don't fish. The floss was useless as it was just too weak. I ended up getting it off with tweezers. I also have a new scratch on the back of my phone. (Good thing [the next iPhone](https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/) is [coming soon](https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/).)

It's a great idea in concept and perhaps if you're lucky enough to have better in-vehicle surfaces to attach the mount to, you'll have a better time than I did. As it stands right now, I'm not sure it'll ever be useful for me. If I still have it when the time comes one day that I replace my car, I might end up using it.

That day isn't today.
