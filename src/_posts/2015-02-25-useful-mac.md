I came across a cool [new site](http://usefulmac.com) this morning by way of [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.com) called [Useful Mac](http://usefulmac.com). While still relatively new, you might find the status bar extension of use. Personally, I'm a fan of the [minimal status bar](http://visnup.github.io/Minimal-Status-Bar/) look. If you enjoy the OS X customization scene, too, you'll enjoy this site as it grows.
