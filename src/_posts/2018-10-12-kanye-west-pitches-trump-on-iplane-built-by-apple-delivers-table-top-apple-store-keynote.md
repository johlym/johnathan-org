From 9to5Mac:

> Kanye West was in Washington D.C today to meet with President Trump in the Oval Office. As you might expect from such a combination of two people, the day wielded some interesting tidbits: an “iPlane” replacement for Air Force One designed by Apple, West's uber-secure iPhone passcode, and a table-top keynote at the Georgetown Apple store.

That's the only paragraph you really need from this story because he said this, in all seriousness:

A piece of work, for sure.
