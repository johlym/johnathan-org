From Amazon:

>  Amazon today announced it is increasing its minimum wage to $15 for all full-time, part-time, temporary (including those hired by agencies), and seasonal employees across the U.S.—effective November 1. The new Amazon $15 minimum wage will benefit more than 250,000 Amazon employees, as well as over 100,000 seasonal employees who will be hired at Amazon sites across the country this holiday.
> “We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon Founder and CEO. “We're excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.”
> Amazon's public policy team will also begin advocating for an increase in the federal minimum wage.

The last sentence gave me a chuckle. The only way they'll be able to do that is state-by-state, and they'll for sure have a hard time in the reddest of states. The current administration isn't likely to ever raise the minimum wage. If they had their way, they'd eliminate it altogether.

Overall, this is great news from a company that was paying on average just $7.25/hour. For those who are already making $15/hour, they are set to see an increase, as well. Many folks are set to see a doubling of their paychecks and I can imagine that'll be a welcome sight.

If only they made it easier for part-time workers to receive benefits.
