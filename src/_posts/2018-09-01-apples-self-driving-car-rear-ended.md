Not that it matters, really–Apple's car wasn't at fault in any way–but the entire article can be summed up in a single paragraph:

> The Apple car, a modified Lexus RX450h SUV carrying special equipment and sensors, was traveling at just 1 mph while preparing to merge onto the Lawrence Expressway in Sunnyvale when a Nissan Leaf rear-ended it going around 15 mph. Apple's Lexus and the Leaf sustained damage, but neither car's passengers received any injuries, the report states.

And done.

I was going to just leave it at that, then I thought some more about this sentence in particular:

> Autonomous software makers may have to take into account how humans tend to behave on the road and inject some of that behavior if they want to avoid these types of crashes in the future.

This is absolutely incorrect. The robot cars should not have to compensate for stupid. Humans need to learn to drive properly, more safely, and above all else, with more awareness. If the Leaf driver was close enough to rear-end a car, they were too close, period. This is a fundamental rule taught everywhere and one that tech journalists (especially ones at The Verge) seem to have forgotten.
