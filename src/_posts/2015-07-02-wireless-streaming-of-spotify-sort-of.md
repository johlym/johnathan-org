I'm not sure why I didn't discover this earlier. My excitement when Spotify came to the PlayStation 4 was moderate and I've been using Spotify as an all-but-replacement for my rotting Apple iTunes (now Apple Music) library for some time.

One thing I never put together until today is that I can control what's playing on my PlayStation 4 via Spotify on my Mac.

I'm sure this isn't news to a lot of people, but it is to me, so you know what…?

…mind blown.
