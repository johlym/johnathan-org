Sara Fischer, Axios:

>  21st Century Fox says will sell its minority stake in Sky Broadcasting to Comcast.
> Comcast just won a dramatic settlement auction over the weekend to buy a minority stake in Sky for roughly $40 billion dollars. Now, they'll own a majority stake in the European Pay-TV and streaming company, which will dramatically increase their international footprint.

This is an interesting turn of events. This makes me wonder if we'll see Sky make its way over the Atlantic to the United States as what I'm sure would be a part of a premium channel lineup that costs a lot of money.

As it stands right now, one can watch Sky News for free already on some streaming platforms here in the United States (I can do so using the Sky app on my Roku).
