From The New York Times' Mike Isaac and Sheera Frenkel:

>  Facebook said on Friday that an attack on its computer network had exposed the personal information of nearly 50 million users.
> The company said it discovered the breach this week. The attackers exploited a feature in Facebook's code that allowed them to take over user accounts. Early Friday, Facebook forced more than 90 million users to log out of their accounts, a common safety measure taken when accounts have been compromised.
> Facebook said it had fixed the vulnerability and notified law enforcement officials.

This explains why I had to re-login to my Facebook account this morning. I wouldn't be surprised if this number ends up growing.

It also doesn't come at a very good time with the [2FA-phone-number-for-marketing shenanigans](/gizmodo-facebook-is-giving-advertisers-access-to-your-shadow-contact-information/) also surfacing.
