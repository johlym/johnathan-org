We’re going to see [The Martian](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_martian/) tomorrow evening. I’m super stoked. I consumed the audiobook via [Audible](http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Martian-Audiobook/B00B5HZGUG) about eight months ago and have wished for a movie ever since.

My only complaint: it’s not in [IMAX](http://imax.com). Space movies need IMAX. C’mon Ridley Scott.
