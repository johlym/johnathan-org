A couple weeks ago, I snagged an [iPad Pro 10.5‚Äù](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/) on a Black Friday deal. At the time, I had a pretty good idea that I'd end up getting an [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/) to go with it.

Sure enough, just last Friday, I waltzed into an Apple Store at 9PM and bought one.

The first thing I found myself doing with it is scribbling in Notes.app. Ten minutes later, I downloaded [Pigment](http://pixiteapps.com/pigment/apple-ipad-pro-pencil.html) and the rest is history.

Really, it's not history, but I'm having a blast and am considering opening a section on my site for some of the work I've done. Pigment lets users export in glorious detail (up to 4096px in either direction) so long as they've paid. At $10/month (or $5/month paid yearly), it's not an inexpensive app, but the flow of designs is strong and the current collection is pretty large.

I've found myself spending several hours at a time just plugging (tapping and stroking?) away at the app and already have a couple pretty cool pieces to show for it.
