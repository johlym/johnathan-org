from The Washington Post:

> Arrivals can take their pick of a white main dining room, someone's idea of a classy-with-a-k interior made possible with red banquettes, purple rugs and truckloads of concrete; an oh-so-green Conservatory set apart by overhead beams draped with faux vines and a bar backed with “portholes” offering an underwater view of the rooftop swimming pool; a Chandelier Room set off with the obvious illumination, just waiting for “The Real Housewives of Potomac” to alight; and the Ledge, a comparatively modest terrace with a bar and views that look onto boat slips and beyond.

I rarely read restaurant reviews in news publications. I couldn't help but consume this one.
