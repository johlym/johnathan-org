- Bun: Chick-Fil-A (buttered)
- Pickles: McDonald's
- Meat: KFC
- Breading and Breading Methodology: Popeye's
- Dry Seasoning: Popeye's
- Sauce: KFC

Optional additions:

- Bacon: McDonald's
- Cheese: Anywhere that offers Pepper Jack or Monterey Jack (single slice)

Vegetables have no place in this.

Jack in the Box and Burger King are subpar in every way. Church's is too inaccessible and too sparsely located to be considered.
