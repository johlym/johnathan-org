Historically, the weekends have been hard on my hobbies.

There’s a photographer that I follow on an occasional basis, mainly because his typical subjects aren’t necessarily family friendly. His name is [Matt Granger](http://mattgranger.com). He has a saying that I’m finding myself stuck to more now than ever: “Get Your Gear Out.”

He’s right. I need to. If I call myself a landscape photographer, why is my camera gear sitting in my bag all the time?

I have a couple locations I want to visit this weekend that are relatively close by (one is just down the street, actually). I’m looking forward to what I can capture this weekend.
