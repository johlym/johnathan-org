I’ve never been to New York City. [Jason Kottke over on Kottke.org](https://kottke.org/18/09/rip-kenny-shopsin) posted about a small restaurant owner that recently passed and quoted a passage [from a 2002 New Yorker profile](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/04/15/dont-mention-it) that makes me sad I never saw the place back then:

>  One evening, when the place was nearly full, I saw a party of four come in the door; a couple of them may have been wearing neckties, which wouldn’t have been a plus in a restaurant whose waitress used to wear a T-shirt that said “Die Yuppie Scum.” Kenny took a quick glance from the kitchen and said, “No, we’re closed.” After a brief try at appealing the decision, the party left, and the waitress pulled the security gate partway down to discourage other latecomers.
> “It’s only eight o’clock,” I said to Kenny.
>  “They were nothing but strangers,” he said.
> “I think those are usually called customers,” I said. “They come here, you give them food, they give you money. It’s known as the restaurant business.”
> Kenny shrugged. “Fuck ‘em,” he said.

Sounds like my kind of guy.

Take it easy, friend.
