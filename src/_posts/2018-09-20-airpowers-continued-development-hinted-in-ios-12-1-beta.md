If you recall, I [mentioned](/additional-details-about-what-happened-to-airpower/) AirPower’s [almost-dead state](/additional-details-about-what-happened-to-airpower/) based on anonymous communications from within Apple. Guilherme Rambo at 9to5Mac has some [new information](https://9to5mac.com/2018/09/20/airpower-referenced-in-iphone-xs-packaging-ios-12-1-code-shows-continuing-development/):

>  The complexity of AirPower has apparently caused a slew of issues for engineers, which is why it’s still not for sale more than a year after its announcement. Originally, Apple said AirPower would be available “in 2018,” so while the company technically hasn’t missed its deadline, it’s clearly running down to the wire.
> However, new evidence from the iPhone XS and iOS 12.1 suggests that, while it may be delayed, development of AirPower continues.
>  Looking into iOS 12.1, we noticed that the component of iOS responsible for managing the charging interface that appears when using AirPower has been updated, which means that Apple is still actively working on the project.
> Furthermore, a picture of the “getting started guide” that comes packaged with the iPhone XS clearly mentions AirPower. “Place iPhone with screen facing up on AirPower or a Qi-certified wireless charger,” it reads. The image was shared on Twitter by Gavin Stephens.

Fantastic news.
