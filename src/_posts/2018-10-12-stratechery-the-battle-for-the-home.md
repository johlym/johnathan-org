Ben Thompson:

> If the first stage of competition in consumer technology was the race to be the computer users went to (won by Microsoft and the PC), and the second was to be the computer users carried with them (won by Apple in terms of profits, and Google in terms of marketshare), the outlines of the current battle came sharply into focus over the last month: what company will win the race to be the computer within which users live?

This is a great read that everyone should comb over. Ben takes a look at each of the four (Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook) and their strengths, weaknesses, their go-to-market status, &nbsp;business models, and their overall strengths and weaknesses. In general, Ben creates great content and if you agree, consider a Stratechery [membership](https://stratechery.com/membership/).
