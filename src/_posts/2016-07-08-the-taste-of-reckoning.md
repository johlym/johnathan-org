I've been waiting to review Appletieser for some time and now that sometime is Friday afternoon. In the past, I've been blocked by cost-prohibition and the fact that the first time I tried ordering it, Amazon sent me Grapetiser. If you haven't read that post, yet, go do it. Now.

I found [a shop in Los Angeles](http://britishfoodshop.com) that sells Appletiser by the can at $2.95. That doesn't seem like a lot, and in reality it's about on par with some of the other beverages I purchased. The downside was shipping. It was $12 to send the can roughly 400 miles up the coast of California. I suppose this was still cheaper than driving down there and buying it in person.

When it arrived, I had to let it chill for a bit. UPS trucks don't have A/C so I hope the fact that it was rather warm when it arrived hasn't spoiled it.

At first smell, I notice the plesant apple scent followed byâ€¦ pasta? It's super subtle, though and might be something else masquerading as something starchy.

At first taste, I'm plesantly surprised. With how Grapetiser turned out, I was expecting Appletiser to fall somewhere in the _tastes like cat litter_ spectrum. I'm sorry I doubted you, Appletiser.

The flavor is subtle and definitely doesn't match the intensity of an American sparkling apple juice. This likely has to do with the different and less added sugar. I'd bet they use green apples in this beverage and if you're an apple eater, you know they're not super sweet but rather tart. It's as if they took straight pressed apple juice and carbonated it. Nothing fancy.

Plus, there's no aftertaste. This was something I was genuinely worried about and am happy to know it's not making an appearance.

Being crisp and fresh without looking gaudy or over the top in packaging is nice to experience. It's fancy without being fancy, and it seems to be popular enough that people drink it in multiple countries. Judging the packaging by itself, there's some room for improvement. The can looks very similar to Grapetiser and I wasn't a huge fan in that camp, either.

Would I drink this again? Probably. Would I pay $12 for a can? Definitely not. If I ever travel to a country that sells it, I'll definitely be sure to grab some.
