It’s not a new post but Jeff Atwood over at Coding Horror [wrote a great piece](https://blog.codinghorror.com/password-rules-are-bullshit/) back in 2017 about the insanity that are password rules. If that’s not a familiar term, think about the times when you’ve created an account at Random Company and they tell you the password has to have at least 8 characters, at least 1 number, 1 symbol (but not $\*@%^), nothing that repeats, no dictionary words, etc… but don’t go over 16 characters, either.
