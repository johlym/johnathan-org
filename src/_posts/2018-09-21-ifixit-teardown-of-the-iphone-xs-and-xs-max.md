iFixit has their hands on the latest iPhones (and they do):

> Last year's iPhone X had a weird name and the most advanced internals we'd ever seen in a teardown. This year Apple turns it up to eleven with the bafflingly-named iPhone XS and XS Max. In a teardown first, we're taking apart both phones simultaneouslyâ€”so grab ahold of your Roman numerals and let's get started.
