Let me tell you a story. A story about Dr. Better. See, Dr. Better wasn't just good, he was better. Better than you and better than me. Dr. Better had a special talent. What was that talent, you ask? Why, being better, of course.

Now you might be wondering, exactly what was he better at? Let me tell you.

Dr. Better was better at being better… cola.

Cola?

Yes. Cola.

Dr. Better was better at Cola than anyone else who claimed to be better. One could argue Dr. Better was the best. Even if he was, he was still better.

Now that Dr. Better's not a mystery, one could wonder if Dr. Better could be a better mystery, too…
