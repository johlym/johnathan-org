> Have I not destroyed my enemy when I have made him into my friend? ~ Abraham Lincoln

So often we spend all of our time trying to literally destroy our enemies and fail to understand that while it may feel good in the short term to have conquered someone with negativity, we're just terrible people.

It's easy to say that while not in the heat of the moment, and sure, words slip from time to time. The point is that using words to put someone down—accidentally or otherwise—didn't just happen by chance.

Instead of using all this energy to bring someone down to your level or below, why not lift them up? There may be a reason why you dislike an individual today, but that reason may not exist for ever.

There are actions that once committed lead to irreversable consiquences, and in those cases, it's wise to just move on without that person in or around your life.

For everyone else, you might be surprised how easy it is to defeat your enemies by becoming friends with them. You might find that whatever was bothering you about them wasn't actually that bad, after all.
