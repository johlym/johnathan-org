Over the last few weeks, I've spent a not-insignificant amount of time thinking about how I wanted to convey all the information and tips I have to share about building a static site and making it good, making it something you want to maintain, and even going so far as to sprinkle a bit of enjoyment on top.

The best way I can think of to do this in a format that makes the most sense to me and how I communicate, is via text and images in a book. Over the coming weeks, I'll take a look at what it'll take to self-publish a book and how I can best offer it to my visitors.

Here's what I know I want to include for sure:

- An overview of the concept of static sites
- Jekyll 101
- Reviewing common tools
- More advanced topics like SEO, caching, and asset management
- A few example sites and how to build them from start to finish using what we've just learned.

As far as a release date, I can only imagine it'll be somewhere between the end of 2018 and all of 2019. I've never done this before so it'll likely take a lot longer than more seasoned writers.

The working title is simply: _The Static Site Book_.

If there's anything in particular you'd like to see, [please let me know](/contact/). I'd love to have the community's help in making this happen.
