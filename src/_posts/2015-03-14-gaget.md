I use [Google Analytics](https://google.com/analytics). It keeps track of all sorts of goodies for me. The thing I like the most and really appreciate is the visitor tracking. I like knowing how many people visit my site on a regular basis. I don't use much outside those base features, though. Good thing there's an app for that.

There's a sick little iPhone and OS X app called [GAget](http://gagetapp.com). It's sole purpose is to provide you with just-the-meat of your [Google Analytics](https://google.com/analytics) data including visitor sessions, bounce rate, new visitor percentage, and visit length. On iOS, this comes in the form of a super clean app that you can scroll though. On OS X, it's a notification center widget. Both are super sexy.

I strongly recommend you check it out on the [OS X App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gaget-simple-widget-for-google/id968487158?mt=12) ($2.99) or the [iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gaget/id716442061) ($1.99).
