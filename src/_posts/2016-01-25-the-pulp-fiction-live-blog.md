Watch Pulp Fiction, they said. It'll be riveting, they said.

I was told today that there's no good reason for not seing Pulp Fiction if I saw Django Unchained or The Hateful Eight. Fine, I said to them. I'll watch it tonight.

So here it is. I watch Pulp Fiction and write about it as the movie plays out. It's 2 hours 33 minutes 59 seconds by Netflix's watch.

Sweet. The classical diner scene. I forgot that guy was in this. What the hell is his name? That accent guy from Star Trek and that show about people's ticks when they lie. I have no idea what he's said. I need to turn up the volume.

“Garson, coffee!” heh. “Garson means boy.” heh heh. I think?

Restaurants don't get robbed because there's too many witnesses.

Yep. This is a Quentin Tarintino movie.

Let's play Spot Spot the Director During His Cameo.

I think I remember starting to watch this movie, and gave up right about… here… the title credits.

Le Big Mac. Mayonaise fries. K.

I always enjoy a movie with Samuel L. Jackson. He's got some greal emotion.

The foot massage logic is sound.

I Also always enjoy a movie with long single takes. This hallway shot is putting this movie on that list.

Staring at the backs of their heads makes me think they're standing at urinals.

I keep lights in all my briefcases.

“Say what! Say what again!”

Don't blink, Bruce!

That band-aid. Was he in The Matrix?

…

Sorry I checked out. Something about Bruce and Mr. Band-Aid and fancy coke. I don't know.

…

I'm a half hour into this movie and have no idea what's going on. Awesome.

…

So THAT's where the lost Travolta meme came from. God he's awkward looking.

Don't be a rectangle composed of a dashed outline.

Slot cars. I remember those. I enjoyed those when I was a kid.

…

This is about where I fall asleep.

Yeah, it was that boring. Sometimes, I just can't get into a movie. I fell asleep at this point and I guess I woke up to turn the TV off. About an hour later, I woke up again, thinking something from the movie snapped me awake but the TV was off. My PS4 running Netflix was still going and the movie was still running.
