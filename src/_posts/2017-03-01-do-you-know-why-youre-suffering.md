That's a fun question, right? _You're upset so while you're upset, think about why_. That's usually not high on the list of _Things to Do_.

It probably should be.

It sounds crazy, but knowing why something is bothersome I think is paramount to understanding it fully. I've found myself employing this tactic a lot over the last year.

Why am I angry? Why do I think this person will do that thing? Why do I hate mushrooms?

That last one I already know–they're disgusting, flavorless, spongey, sprouting dirt turds… but hey, I didn't always have such a wonderful answer. ?

Mark Manson covers this in _[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck](https://amzn.to/2J2k4Bh)_. He tells the story of [Hiroo Onoda](https://amzn.to/2J2k4Bh), a Japanese soldier that spent almost 30 years in the Philipenes, fighting a war that had ended. He led a pretty terrible life in the jungle but had a clear purpose for it. It was his mission. He was suffering for what he believed was a good cause.

When we think about why we're feeling a way about something or why we're choosing to live in a poor moment, it's not necessarily a bad thing for it to be a less-than-ieal situation. The key is being alright with it. Onoda accepted the situation he was in so you, too, can accept that Christmas with your in-laws is garbage but you love your wife and she really enjoys spending time with your family. That's actually two reasons!
