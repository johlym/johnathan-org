I brought my computer with me on the bus this morning to see if I could write while riding and came to one horrible conclusion. It's impossible. One thing bus manufacturers haven't thought about it making enough space for people to do work comfortably. What's up with that? Then there's those crazy side-facing seats. I unfortunately was limited to one of those for a place to sit, if I didn't want to share with someone and have them look over my shoulder. Aside: don't think the person next to you isn't glancing down at your screen. I'm talking to you, co-workers who work for one of the biggest software companies in the world.

The above paragraph was written solely while riding public transportation. As it turns out, it's incredibly hard to do. The seats are too close together. Maybe I have too big of a computer. Perhaps wanting to have a decently-sized keyboard and a good screen to look at is too much to ask. I should be using an iPad these days, right? Or better yet, just blogging on my phone because that's what the kids do.

Whatever. I want to use my computer. There's not much else to this post besides me complaining that I can't blog on the bus the way I want to. I should probably just stick to blogging at my desk. I seem to enjoy it much more, there. Plus, there's no one looking over my shoulder as I type. (fact: big pet peeve)
