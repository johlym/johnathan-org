Bloomberg reported that China manufacturing facilities had implanted spying chips in Supermicro computers. DHS disagrees:

> The Department of Homeland Security said Saturday that it is aware of reports that Amazon and Apple network servers may have been compromised by Chinese spy microchips, and that it currently has “no reason to doubt the statements from the companies named in the story.”

This story gets stranger by the day.
