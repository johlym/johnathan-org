From The Hollywood Reporter:

>  Burt Reynolds, the charismatic star of such films as _Deliverance_, _The Longest Yard_ and _Smokey and the Bandit_ who set out to have as much fun as possible on and off the screen — and wildly succeeded — has died. He was 82.
> Reynolds, who received an Oscar nomination when he portrayed porn director Jack Horner in Paul Thomas Anderson's _Boogie Nights_ (1997) and was the No. 1 box-office attraction for a five-year stretch starting in the late 1970s, died Thursday morning at Jupiter Medical Center in Florida, his manager, Erik Kritzer, told The Hollywood Reporter.

Over and out.
