 **Update:** I changed back over to WordPress. ?

Over the last few weeks, I've mulled over in my mind–several times, in fact–going back to WordPress for the simple reason that a static site, while fast and relatively secure, it hard to scale. It's also a bit more difficult than I would like to post on a regular basis. I enjoy Forestry a lot, actually, but I'd rather use tools like MarsEdit, something I can't do right now.

Updates to posts require multiple steps and as my post count grows, it just gets more out of control.

What's holding me back at the moment is creating a WordPress theme (again). I didn't really enjoy doing it the first time around. ?
