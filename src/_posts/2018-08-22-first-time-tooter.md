Coming right out and saying it, Mastodon is no replacement for Twitter. I make sure to share this twitter thread with anyone that is even remotely considering the platform.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
THREAD: In light of so many folks moving to Mastodon/the Fediverse, i want to re-up a couple of threads i did last year about safety and other issues. None of these have gone away, and the increased volume is gonna make them worse, not better.

Joe Steel’s [longer take](http://joe-steel.com/2018-08-20-First-Time-Tooter-Long-Time-Tweeter.html) on it is pretty dang good and he’s much more open-minded about the entire concept, so his post is definitely worth a read. His opening take sums it up pretty well:

> The short version is that Mastodon clones features of Twitter with open source software that can be run on any server. Those servers talk to each other and form a larger world than any one server could. The default place most people land is [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/) but they have halted admissions because of the large influx of people leaving Twitter at the same time. You can join [mastodon.cloud](https://mastodon.cloud/) or any other server. Since your server can talk to the others, and you can move your account to another one, there’s no immediate pressure. There’s a timeline which is functionally like Twitter – or at least how it was back when it was chronological. You can mute, block, follow, etc.

I’m not sure what to think, just yet. I have an account set up somewhere but I don’t remember anything about it–a problem I’m sure would be solved by digging into emails.
