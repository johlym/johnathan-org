>  The Philips Play is a short, rigid lightstrip primarily designed for entertainment consoles. It will be available in single units for $69.95 or in a more useful double pack for $129.95. This compares with $89.95 for [the existing Lightstrip](https://amzn.to/2vZg1Nx).

It sounds like Philips is expanding their Hue lineup even further, which is a terrible thing to hear for people like me that love spending too much money on Hue devices. I have 7 color bulbs, two Blooms, two strips, and two Gos. No plans on stopping, either, and these new items look pretty dang sweet.
