## **Apple Watch**

- The Series 4 will come in two sizes: 40mm and 44mm. This measures the case size, which lines up with Apple's explanation that the screen is 32% and 35% larger, respectively, while also being a bit thinner.

- Series 3 will fall into the slot of the low-end Watch offering.
- All existing watch bands will fit the Series 4.
- Watch faces will be more highly customizable with complications from both Apple and 3rd-party developers. Some faces will feature more extensive complication arrangements, too.
- The Watch will be able to more closely track heart behaviors and optionally notify emergency services if a fall event occurs where medical attention is required.
- Pricing will break down as follows (all US dollars; 40mm/44mm; sport bands):
  - Aluminum&nbsp;GPS: $399 / $429;&nbsp;GPS + Cellular: $499 / $529
