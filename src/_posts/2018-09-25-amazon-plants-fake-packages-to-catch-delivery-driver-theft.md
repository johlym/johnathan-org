[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-sets-traps-for-drivers-2018-9):

>  The company plants the packages — internally referred to as “dummy” packages — in the trucks of drivers at random. The dummy packages have fake labels and are often empty.
> “We might pull something out of our pocket and put it in there” to give it some weight, a former Amazon logistics manager told Business Insider. This person, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, said instructions for the practice came from Amazon's corporate offices in Seattle.
> “It's meant to be a trap … to check the integrity of the driver,” he said.

I've had an Amazon box show up already opened (cut, not hastily taped) so whatever Amazon thinks is necessary is entirely fine by me. The contents were left behind probably because it was a water filter for my refrigerator… not something valuable or of interest to most individuals. I had one other package never “arrive” (a Philips Hue bulb, about $50 in value) though it was marked as delivered. It took several hoop jumping events to convince Amazon customer service that it never arrived. I had to explain to them that 99.95% of my deliveries landed in a secure package locker (even from Amazon's own delivery cronies) and that if it wasn't here, it really wasn't here. There was no where else to put the package.

I would just as well prefer Amazon stopped using their delivery drivers so much, too. They tend to be quite haphazard in their delivery processes and always seem to be stumped when they encounter a building that requires an access code (like mine) or a package locker. It might help if I was able to give Amazon more detailed instructions on how to delivery properly, but as of right now, that's too much to ask.
