[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-21/uber-harassment-settlement-56-workers-to-split-1-9-million):

> The cost of Uber Technologies Inc.'s sexual harassment scandal is now itemized: 56 current and former employees who filed claims stand to collect an average of $33,928.57.

Funny. I wonder if this is being evaluated within the scope of their [pending IPO](https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/21/technology/uber-cfo-nelson-chai/index.html)?
