One thing I've always found so amazing is that with today's excellent blend of technologies to keep people living longer, we regularly see people living past 100 years of age.

>  How do you live to be 109 years old? Exercise, a nice warm bowl of porridge, and staying away from menâ€”at least that's the explanation given by Scotland's oldest woman, Jessie Gallan, in a story that [went viral earlier this year](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2912299/Scotland-s-oldest-woman-Jessie-Gallan-reveals-longevity-secrets-including-eating-porridge-avoiding-men.html).

It's quite wild to think that there's a possibility I might live to be that long. Shortly after that realization another one hits: I'm going to need to save more for retirement. Most retirement plans account for 20-30 years between retirement and death. If I want to stick to my valiant plans of retiring at 55, I'm going to need more than that. If I'm Jessie, I'll need 50 years. Oh boy. Good thing there are services to help manage money out there. I'm not sure I could do that on my own.

I'm not even going to start on the age of the [oldest living woman](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2572316/The-secret-long-life-Sushi-sleep-according-worlds-oldest-woman.html) at 118 years. I just can't. It's daunting to think that there's so much more life left to live after retirement for some people. Usually when you reach that point, things change and daily life changes. I don't think I could deal with that for over 60 years.

Then again, I could just retire later, too.

That's so long from now, God only knows what'll happen.
