As someone who has followed WordPress' progress for several years–I remember deploying WordPress version 2.5–seeing version 5.0 make its debut was exciting.

It's just as fast as version 4 and the new editor is pretty slick. My current theme structure doesn't seem to mind it, which is great. I've pared down so much of WordPress' functionality in my theme, I'm not sure I'll see a whole lot of difference, save for the same in-app post editor–named Gutenberg–that made its formal debut.

I am using it to write this post now, and it feels totally fine. The block functionality reminds me of Medium. In fact, if I knew nothing about Gutenberg's release, I can see how I'd be mistaken if I thought WordPress patterned with Medium.

The drop-cap functionality is kind of cool. My styling doesn't allow for it, but that's okay. It's never been something I've felt was important to implement with a sans-serif font.

Crazy times, these are.
