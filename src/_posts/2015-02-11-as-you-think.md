I read some powerful words, yesterday, and I knew right away they were worth discussing.

>  As you think, so shall you become.
> â€“ Unknown

It's powerful stuff but the words speak a simple message. We're surrounded my many different influences that can shape our thoughts and actions, but the biggest influence is ourselves. We're the ones that make the final decision on whether to act a certain way, and those decisions are based on the thoughts we have. Having a positive mind leads to leading a positive life, but one cannot have the latter without the former. It cannot be expected that by being negative and pessimistic on the inside will still allow for an upbeat life on the outside. Take care of yourself by taking care of where your head is at. It's the first and biggest step to improving anything and everything else around you.
