I saw this first posted [on Mashable](https://mashable.com/article/mcdonalds-fake-poster-prank/#pX9wee.7jaqK); these guys noticed a blank wall in their local McDonald’s so they did what I’m sure _everyone_ would do: they created a fake McD poster of themselves and hung it up.

51 days later… it’s still there.
