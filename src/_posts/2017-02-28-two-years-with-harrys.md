I don't usually talk about my razor. I'm thinking today's a good day to change that.

A little over [two years ago](https://johnathan.org/posts/2015/02/harrys.html), I wrote about [Harry's](https://harrys.com). They touted shaving products that don't break the bank. Since then, I've used their products almost exclusively and am still a happy customer. I thought I'd share a bit of their story and how Harry's came to be.

And ladies: you can use [Harry's](https://harrys.com) too. ?

I'm still such a fan, that even two years later I'm creating my own product shots (just like I did in 2015; the header image).
