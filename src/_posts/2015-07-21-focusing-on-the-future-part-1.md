I've been internally reflecting on the future of my career quite a bit over the last month or so. One thing I know for sure is where I want my career to head, but what I'm not 100% sure about is how to get there.

My overall plan is to pivot into software development. I enjoy solving technical puzzles, fixing things, and making things, all of which can be accomplished with great detail and satisfaction in software development. At this time I haven't picked a single language or group of languages to stick to and become an expert in. I feel that'll come within the next few months.

In the meantime, I have to figure out how to best build up these new skills I require while still maintaining my current day job, which I don't dislike.
