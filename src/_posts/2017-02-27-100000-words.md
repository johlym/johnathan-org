This is a statistic I never though I'd reach.

Yesterday I crossed the 100,000 word mark for all the posts I've written on this blog. From [the very first on September 9th, 2014](https://johnathan.org/posts/2014/09/create-a-photograph.html), to yesterday, 100,337 words have been written and published. I'm sure I crossed that mark earlier, but since I removed a few posts a couple months ago, the real count didn't touch this level until [yesterday's post](https://johnathan.org/posts/2017/02/special-snowflakes.html).

I'm quite excited to have come this far and look forward to what I come up with for the next 100,000 words. I'd also like to give a quick thank you to [John Saddington](http://john.do) for his inspiration to blog regularly. He's been at it [for over fifteen years](https://john.do/every-single-day/) and while I don't quite have the regularity he does, I still feel I've accomplished something great.

To give you an idea of the scale [using book types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_count):

- Children's chapter book: 16,000
- Typical mystery novel: 60-80,000
- Typical “thriller”: 100,000+

Quite amazing.
