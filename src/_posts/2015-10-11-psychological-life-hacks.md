Every time we meet or communicate with someone, be it face to face, over the phone (who does that anymore), text message, email, Skype, etc., we have a fresh opportunity to make the best of the situation.

[High Existence](http://www.highexistence.com/25-psychological-life-hacks-help-gain-advantage-social-situations/) has a great [article](http://www.highexistence.com/25-psychological-life-hacks-help-gain-advantage-social-situations/) listing 25 “[life hacks](http://www.highexistence.com/25-psychological-life-hacks-help-gain-advantage-social-situations/)” to make the most of social situations. Number eight is key for me. I'm terrible at remembering names. Number 12 is so true, too.

The key in all this isn't to necessarily dominate in a conversation, but to use certain things, triggers, the environment, and each others strengths and weaknesses to your advantage.

I'll admit there are quite a few in this article that I could learn and use in my own life.
