Ever heard the saying:

> I'm turning over a new leaf?

I'd say that, but in this case, the leaf is the same one. This morning I took the time to get back into a morning routine that makes me feel the best.

I'm also working on better planning of my week, as per this video:

If you're not doing this, do it with me. I'd love to hear how it goes.
