When I came across this book, I knew right away it would be epic. Tom Cotter covers a plethora of vehicular categories, including two-wheeled find, muscle cars and classic Americana, race cars, oddities and one-offs, and more. It’s running for [about $23 on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2x7L4pY) right now and is worth every penny. Go check it out.
