Sometime in the next couple weeks I'll be starting the first book discussion of 2018. I've been wanting to discuss this topic for a long time. I want to talk about the topic of remote work and address some of the stigma behind it, along with some tips and stories from my own experiences working remotely 100% for the last two years.

The companion book is _[Remote: Office Not Required](http://amzn.to/2smrQxV)_ from 37Signals founders David Heinemeier Hansson and Jason Fried. I highly recommend picking it up and following along as each post will use parts from the book as their base for discussion.

Stay tuned for the first post.
