Thanks to [Jason Kottke](https://kottke.org/18/10/quick-podcast-recommendations), I came across [CBC Uncover: Escaping NXIVM](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcasts/current-affairs-information/uncover/):

> NXIVM calls itself a humanitarian community. Experts call it a cult. Uncover: Escaping NXIVM is an investigative podcast series about the group, its leader Keith Raniere and one woman's journey to get out.

This is a great podcast and if you liked Serial, Making a Murderer, and others like it, definitely check it out. It's available on just about every podcast platform you can think of.
