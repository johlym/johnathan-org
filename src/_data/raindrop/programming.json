Including RuboCop’s “own” parser (a.k.a whitequark/parser), which aimed to replace ripper and ruby_parser, back when it was created. I’ve been keeping an eye on Prism for while, as RuboCop has long been criticized for its choice of parser (and more specifically - for that parser being somewhat slow). That being said - parser migrations are always a pain, especially in a project as big as RuboCop. Early on I had to essentially rewrite RuboCop when I switched the codebase from ripper to parser, and back then RuboCop was a lot smaller. The good thing is that such rewrites can be done incrementally (I was migrating cops in batches), but it was still a lot of (boring, repetitive) work. That’s why I was super happy when I recently discovered parser-prism - a gem that provides a new backend for the parser gem’s syntax tree that uses the Prism parser. To make things better - it seemed that this library actually worked with RuboCop already. Yeah, the users still had to do some manual work, but it turned out that the migration could be a lot simpler than what I had expected. Did I also mention some mighty impressive benchmarks? As a whole, this parser should be significantly faster than the parser gem. The bin/bench script in this repository compares the performance of Parser::CurrentRuby and Parser::Prism. Running against a large file like lib/parser/prism/compiler.rb yields: Warming up -------------------------------------- Parser::CurrentRuby 1.000 i/100ms Parser::Prism 6.000 i/100ms Calculating ------------------------------------- Parser::CurrentRuby 16.642 (± 0.0%) i/s - 84.000 in 5.052021s Parser::Prism 64.951 (± 3.1%) i/s - 330.000 in 5.088147s Comparison: Parser::Prism: 65.0 i/s Parser::CurrentRuby: 16.6 i/s - 3.90x slower When running with --yjit, the comparison is even more stark: Warming up -------------------------------------- Parser::CurrentRuby 1.000 i/100ms Parser::Prism 9.000 i/100ms Calculating ------------------------------------- Parser::CurrentRuby 20.062 (± 0.0%) i/s - 101.000 in 5.034389s Parser::Prism 112.823 (± 9.7%) i/s - 558.000 in 5.009460s Comparison: Parser::Prism: 112.8 i/s Parser::CurrentRuby: 20.1 i/s - 5.62x slower These benchmarks were run on a single laptop without a lot of control for other processes, so take them with a grain of salt. Note: The results above were taken straight from parser-prism’s README. In a nutshell we’re looking into something like 4-6 times speedup!!! Now I was VERY excited! Immediately I created an issue to improve the support for Prism in RuboCop and we’ve started to collaborate with Prism’s author Kevin Newton, who has been very supportive and accommodating. I suggest to everyone interested in the topic to peruse the discussion in this issue (and issues references from it), as we’ve already managed to simplify the usage of RuboCop with Prism quite a bit. And we’re very close to addressing the main outstanding item - multi-versioning for the parser. Basically, the parser gem allows you to select the version of Ruby to parse code as (e.g. 3.1), independently from the version of Ruby runtime. This powers the TargetRubyVersion configuration option in RuboCop and was one of the many reasons for picking parser over ripper back in the day. In practical terms - this allowed us to keep supporting parsing Ruby 2.x code, long after one couldn’t run RuboCop on Ruby 2.x. To put it in different terms - the versions of Ruby that RuboCop understands (can parse) are completely orthogonal to the versions of Ruby on which RuboCop can be run. This and other items we need to address, are nicely summarized here. None of them seems like a particularly hard obstacle, so I’m quite optimistic about the future. A future in which one day you’ll be able to have this in your RuboCop config: ParserEngine: prism When is this going to happen exactly? No promises yet, but at the current pace it will likely happen sooner rather than later. I’d encourage adventurous people to play with RuboCop on Prism and to contribute to getting all required pieces in place faster. I recall that RuboCop’s adoption of whitequar/parser was instrumental in uncovering (many) weird bugs in it, and I have a feeling that things might be the same for parser-prism as well. (I assume a lot less projects use parser-prism compared to Prism) Exciting times ahead! That’s all I have for you today!
