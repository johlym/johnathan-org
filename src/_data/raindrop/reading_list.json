Knowing that existing research was already out there for this device, it seemed like it would be a slam dunk. Little did I realize the project would turn into a roller coaster ride with over three months of experimentation, failures, successes, and heart-stopping moments. It reminded me that hacking is always unpredictable, exciting, and educational, no matter how long you've been doing it. In this case, the stakes were higher than normal: I only had one chance to get it right. \n\nRead about it on The Verge: https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/24/22898712/crypto-hardware-wallet-hacking-lost-bitcoin-ethereum-nft\n\nCheck out Joe Grand here:\nYouTube: https://youtube.com/c/JoeGrand\nWebsite: http://www.grandideastudio.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/joegrand\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nwallet.fail: https://wallet.fail\nColin O'Flynn: https://twitter.com/colinoflynn\nNewAE Technology: https://newae.com\nMacdonald Entertainment Partners: https://macdonaldentertainmentpartners.com\nChase McDaniel: https://www.mercuryroadmedia.com\nDan Reich: https://danreich.com/i-had-2-million-dollars-in-crypto-locked-on-a-wallet\n\nABOUT OFFSPEC.IO\n\noffspec.io (https://offspec.io) is a dedicated team of hackers and entrepreneurs specializing in password recovery from hardware and software wallets.
