notes:
  - There is no such thing as too many diapers.
  - There is no such thing as enough diapers.
  - (US) Get a Costco membership. Their diaper prices are hyper-competitive.
  - Figure out a shift schedule for sleeping as early as possible.
  - If you have leave options, don't feel bad for taking as much as you can.
  - Frustration is normal; this is new and routines were upended suddenly.
  - Find ways to be helpful wherever possible; the baby's mother is under a lot of stress of her own right now.
