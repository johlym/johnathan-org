notes:
  - There is no such thing as too many diapers.
  - There is no such thing as enough diapers.
  - (US) Get a Costco membership. Their diaper prices are hyper-competitive.
  - Figure out a shift schedule for sleeping as early as possible.
  - If you have leave options, don't feel bad for taking as much as you can.
  - Frustration is normal; this is new and routines were upended suddenly.
  - Find ways to be helpful wherever possible; the baby's mother is under a lot of stress of her own right now.
  - The stress means you're human.
  - You're doing the best you can.
  - Take more leave than you think you'll need. That N weeks will sneak up on you fast and you'll wish you took more.
  - Find people to share your stories with.
  - The first year is going to blow by. When it's over, you'll likely only remember the best parts. Your brain will have sequestered the sleepless nights, sadness, frustration, and anger.
  - Continue to do the best you can.
  - You're doing a great job.
  - When they start to walk, you'll wish they were still crawling.
  - When they start to talk, you'll wish they were still babbling.
  - When they start to run, you'll wish they were still walking.
  - When they start to read, you'll be dumfounded by how quickly they're learning.
  - Every moment you see them doing something new for the first time feels like a straight dopamine hit.
  - Their first boo-boo is the saddest one.
  - Start teaching them things you're interested in early.
  - I've started showing our daughter the various tools in the garage. I also take her to the home improvement store with me and show her all the things there.
  - Watching her say the word "level" or "hammer" for the first time is almost too much to handle in the moment.
