<p>Find three hobbies you love: one to make you money, one to keep you in shape, and one to be creative.</p>

Bonus points if you have one über-hobby that gets you all three. In my case, photography is that hobby. I'm not quite covered on #1 and #2, but &nbsp;it'll take time. No hobby is a money printer or @$$ kicker overnight (unless you print money while standing on one leg holding a medicine ball and painting at the same time).
