Another one [bites the dust](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/manafort-jury-suggests-it-cannot-come-to-a-consensus-on-a-single-count/2018/08/21/a2478ac0-a559-11e8-a656-943eefab5daf_story.html?utm_term=.d1955d9c13af):

>  A jury has found former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort guilty after a three-week trial on tax and bank fraud charges â€” a major if not complete victory for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as he continues to investigate the president's associates.
> The jury convicted Manafort on eight of the 18 counts against him. The jury said it was deadlocked on the other 10. U.S. District Court Judge T.S. Ellis declared a mistrial on those other charges.
> Manafort was convicted on five counts of filing false tax returns, one count of not filing a required IRS form, and two bank fraud counts.
